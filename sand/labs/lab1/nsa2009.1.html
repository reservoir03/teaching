<b>Summary</b><p>

<blockquote>

This data set contains responses to repeated presentations of
particular incoherent, random dot patterns.  Specific analysis of this
data is described in Bair and Koch (1996).  The data for each neuron
are presented here in two files, one containing trials where the
randomization seed was varied from trial to trial (file name ending in
<b>v</b>) and one where the randomization seed was held constant (file
name ending in <b>c</b>).  Each trial has two variable parameters,
direction and response.  The direction value has no meaning by itself
because the dots were incoherent, thus there was no directional
signal.  The response value indicates whether the subject chose the
"correct" or "incorrect" direction, meaning the direction assigned to
the trial, even though direction has no influence on the stimulus
pattern (0-wrong, 1-correct).  These trials were interleaved with
higher coherence trials, thus the subject had incentive to work and
did not know that these were zero-coherence trials.  All data files
are from subject
<i>e</i>.<p>

</blockquote>

<b>Stimulus</b><p>

The stimulus was a sparse, dynamic random dot pattern lasting for
typically 2 seconds.  The motion coherence was zero.  A full
description of the stimulus is provided in Britten et al. (1992).
